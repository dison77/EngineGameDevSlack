#Purpose
EngineGameDev.slack.com is intended to be a community for experienced and aspiring game developers with a focus on low level programming, engine development, graphics development, C/C++/asm, console development (as long as it's not in violation of any NDA), etc.
We believe our community should be truly open for everyone. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, or religion.
This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participant behavior as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.
We invite all participants to help us realize a safe and positive conference experience for everyone.
All determinations of appropriate or inappropriate behavior are in administrators' sole discretion and the decision(s) of the administrators will be final.

#Expected Behavior
- Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.

#Unacceptable Behavior
-Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning conduct by any team members.
-Harassment includes: offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; unwelcome sexual attention.
-Physical, written, verbal or other abuse, intimidation, threats, annoyance, harassment, stalking, pushing, shoving or use of any physical force whatsoever against any person, which in any way creates a disturbance that is disruptive or dangerous, or creates apprehension in a person, as determined by EngineGameDev administrators, in their sole discretion.
-Any lewd or offensive behavior or language, including but not limited to using sexually explicit or offensive language, materials or conduct, or any language, behavior or content that contains obscenities, or racial, religious, gender, or ethnic slurs.
-Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
-Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission. This includes any sort of “outing” of any aspect of someone’s identity without their consent.
-Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or community setting.

#When Something Happens
If you see a Code of Conduct violation, follow these steps:

1. Let the person know that what they did is not appropriate and ask them to stop and/or edit their message(s).
2. That person should immediately stop the behavior and correct the issue.
3. If this doesn’t happen, or if you’re uncomfortable speaking up, contact admins (/admin on slack, DM @dison77 on twitter, mbreindel@gmail.com with "ENGINEGAMEDEV: URGENT" in the subject).
4. As soon as available, an admin will join, identify themselves, and take further action (see below), starting with a warning, then temporary deactivation, then long-term deactivation.
When reporting, please include any relevant details, links, screenshots, context, or other information that may be used to better understand and resolve the situation.

#Scope
We expect all participants (team members and administrators) to abide by this code of conduct at all times in this team.
